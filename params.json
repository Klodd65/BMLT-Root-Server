The suggested model is that a Region set up and maintain this server, while Area Services set up [\"satellite\" servers](http://bmlt.magshare.net/satellites/).\r\n\r\nIn order to use this server, you should [download a zip](https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Root-Server/archive/Release.zip) of [the \"release\" branch](https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Root-Server) of the code, and install it as a standalone Web site on your own Web server. [Here are instructions for finding out if your Web server is set up correctly.](http://bmlt.magshare.net/specific-topics/server-requirements/)\r\n\r\nOnce you have it set up, then load it with meeting data, and get satellites connected to it.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system\r\nthat has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-\r\nscheduled weekly, recurring events.\r\n\r\nThe intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT\r\nserver, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.\r\n\r\nYou can find out way too much about the BMLT here: http://bmlt.magshare.org\r\n\r\nThis project is the \"root\" server for the BMLT. It is the \"server\" part of the BMLT\r\n\"client/server\" architecture.\r\n\r\nThe project is actually several years old. To see the pre-GitHub history, visit the\r\noriginal SourceForge page at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/\r\n\r\nI decided to start new on GitHub, as opposed to bringing over the SourceForge project,\r\nin order to reduce disk space usage, and because it's a pain to rearrange a standard\r\nSVN structure to Git.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe entire system is written in PHP, JavaScript, XHTML and CSS. Most of the code is PHP.\r\n\r\nPHP 5.1 or above is required to establish a root server, and 5.0 or above for a satellite.\r\n\r\nFor more information about server requirements, see this page:\r\n\r\n    http://bmlt.magshare.net/advanced-topics/server-requirements/\r\n \r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou set up a root server as the central database and administration area for a BMLT\r\nimplementation, but most people access it through what we call \"satellite servers.\" These\r\nsatellites comprise the \"client\" part of the BMLT \"client/server\" architecture.\r\n\r\nFor instructions on installing the root server, see this page:\r\n\r\n    http://bmlt.magshare.net/root-server/\r\n\r\nCHANGELIST\r\n----------\r\n= Version 1.10.3\r\n* January 16, 2013\r\n* Added a \"GetServiceBodies\" variant to the semantic export.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.10.2\r\n* January 8, 2013\r\n* The miles from search center value was incorrect (improper conversion from Km). This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.10.1\r\n* The main change in this version is that the formats can be exported so that only the ones actually used in the search are given.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.9 =\r\n* March 24, 2012\r\n* Fixed a bug that did not apply localizations to PDF generation.\r\n* Fixed a bug in the Metaphone splitter (It was in rarely used code, and had been there forever).\r\n* Added some functionality to aid in syncing with the NAWS system.\r\n* Changed the base \"primer\" DB to include the new standard set of formats to be used to sync with NAWS.\r\n* Changed the way the \"install wizard\" works, in order to make it easier to \"prime\" the database.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.43 =\r\n* November 24, 2011\r\n* Undid the date bug fix, as it caused problems on some servers, by reporting the wrong times.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.42 =\r\n* November 17, 2011\r\n* Fixed a bug in which day/time searches were being offset improperly on some servers.\r\n* Fixed a bug, in which the CSV response could cause a crash.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.41 =\r\n* October 22, 2011\r\n* Addressed a bug, in which the wrong timezone was possibly being specified. The auto-config file will now allow a timezone to be specified in a variable called $default_timezone.\r\n* Somehow or another, some junk characters got into the AJAX Thread Driver file. That has been fixed.\r\n\t    \r\n= Version 1.8.40 =\r\n* October 21, 2011\r\n* Swedish localization added.\r\n* There was a minor error in the XML schema for formats that interfered with operation on the iPhone app. This has been fixed.\r\n\t    \r\n= Version 1.8.39 =\r\n* September 5, 2011\r\n* NA Sweden had an error, in which their server reports that it has all the various crypt() methodologies, but can't actually deliver. This broke the FullCrypt() function. I addressed it by adding a fallback to the most primitive crypt() function.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.38 =\r\n* August 17, 2011\r\n* This addresses an issue where overrides of the address format strings were being ignored. It may also give a slight improvement to page load times.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.37 =\r\n* August 15, 2011\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the \"Contact Us About This Meeting\" link from appearing in \"More Details.\"\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.36 =\r\n* August 12, 2011\r\n* Fixed a bug discovered by UKNA, in which subsequent pages of a multi-page location result woul have bad links.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.35 =\r\n* July 11, 2011\r\n* Fixed a couple of minor bugs in the installer wizard.\r\n* Also added a change to the search spec. throbber location that should make it appear in the correct place, now.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.34 =\r\n* July 4, 2011\r\n* Fixed a validation issue with the search form.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.33 =\r\n* June 26, 2011\r\n* Added new fields to the CSV/JSON/XML Change response.\r\n* There was a minor security issue that could have occurred with the email_contact field. It may have been displayed in some change records. This has been addressed.\r\n* Made the changes response dig into a hierarchy of Service bodies, if a \"parent\" Service body ID is presented in service_body_id=\r\n\t    \r\n= Version 1.8.32 =\r\n* June 22, 2011\r\n* Added the ability to filter by Service body, when looking for changes, and now only return meeting changes (previously, some Service body and user changes could also be supplied).\r\n* Made a minor fix in the default details address string, so that meeting locations with no name won't show an empty comma.\r\n* Added the address format strings to the shared local strings, which should help performance, and decouple the linking to global variables.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.31 =\r\n* June 7, 2011\r\n* Added additional capability to the CSV, JSON and XML outputs, so that the Satellite Driver can extract more relevant information.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.30 =\r\n* June 5, 2011\r\n* Fixed a fairly minor bug, in which failed geocode lookups would result in a blank screen. They now result in a message.\r\n\r\n= Version 1.8.29 =\r\n* June 4, 2011\r\n* Initial check-in of GitHub project\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
