        <h1>BMLT Root Server</h1>

<p>BMLT (**B**asic <strong>M</strong>eeting <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>T</strong>oolbox) Root Server Source Code.</p>

<p>This is the code that implements <a href="http://bmlt.magshare.net/root-server/">the central ("root") server</a>. The suggested model is that a Region set up and maintain this server, while Area Services set up <a href="http://bmlt.magshare.net/satellites/">"satellite" servers</a>.</p>

<p>In order to use this server, you should <a href="https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Root-Server/archive/Release.zip">download a zip</a> of <a href="https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Root-Server">the "release" branch</a> of the code, and install it as a standalone Web site on your own Web server. <a href="http://bmlt.magshare.net/specific-topics/server-requirements/">Here are instructions for finding out if your Web server is set up correctly.</a></p>

<p>Once you have it set up, then load it with meeting data, and get satellites connected to it.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.</p>

<p>It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-
scheduled weekly, recurring events.</p>

<p>The intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT
server, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.</p>

<p>You can find out way too much about the BMLT here: <a href="http://bmlt.magshare.org">http://bmlt.magshare.org</a></p>

<p>This project is the "root" server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT
"client/server" architecture.</p>

<p>The project is actually several years old. To see the pre-GitHub history, visit the
original SourceForge page at: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/</a></p>

<p>I decided to start new on GitHub, as opposed to bringing over the SourceForge project,
in order to reduce disk space usage, and because it's a pain to rearrange a standard
SVN structure to Git.</p>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>The entire system is written in PHP, JavaScript, XHTML and CSS. Most of the code is PHP.</p>

<p>PHP 5.1 or above is required to establish a root server, and 5.0 or above for a satellite.</p>

<p>For more information about server requirements, see this page:</p>

<pre><code>http://bmlt.magshare.net/advanced-topics/server-requirements/
</code></pre>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>You set up a root server as the central database and administration area for a BMLT
implementation, but most people access it through what we call "satellite servers." These
satellites comprise the "client" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.</p>

<p>For instructions on installing the root server, see this page:</p>
